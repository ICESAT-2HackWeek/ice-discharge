I am Hui who is doing a PhD in Glaciology at the University at Buffalo. My interests include reconstructing ice sheet mass balance using laser altimetry measurements and investigating the interactions among ice, ocean, and atmosphere. I had a bachelor's degree in remote sensing, and I am using remote sensing data for my PhD research. I am a participant in the ice-discharge project for hackweek 2022.

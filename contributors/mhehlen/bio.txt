Hi, I'm Mark. I recently finished a post baccalaureate degree in geology from the University of Vermont where I specialized in glaciology, structural geology, and remote sensing. My prior degree is in mathematics and statistics from Portland State University. I am currrently seeking funding for my PhD program in ice sheet modelling. 

I pitched the ice-discharge project for hackweek 2022 and am acting not so much as a team lead as a committee chair. Our goal is to create a usable workflow for Antarctic solid ice discharge on the catchment scale within the timeframe of our collaboration here.
